This directory contains the Source code, input files and post-processing script 

for the SedDOM-SFM model (Clark et al., 2017).  

We would like to acknowledge Dominic DiToro, Carl Cerco and James Fitzpatrick for the original model development.
See DiToro's website at: http://www.ce.udel.edu/faculty/ditoro/sedimentfluxmodeling.html 

You can also see a current PNNL project using coupled sediment-water column modeling in the Salish Sea, Pacific Northwest of North America.
http://salish-sea.pnnl.gov/

Validation data in the form of a matlab structure, fluxzilla.mat, was collected by the GONZO research group from Chesapeake Biological 
Laboratory in Solomons Island, MD, headed by Dr. Walter Boynton.  Wothout there efforts to collect and compile this comprehensive
sediment flux database, this modeling effort would be severely limited.

===================================================================

To run the model
1. Go into the source directory and alter the makefile to have the appropriate directories for each dependency
    
to build the executable file type

make

2.  Specify the file you want to run for the overlying water column chemical constituents in sedtest_2c.inp

	PNPT ---> Point No Point
	RGPT ---> Ragged Point
	R64  ---> R-64

	the files with the string "fluxDO" on the end use the Fluxzilla 
	dissolved oxygen data rather than the Chesapeake bay Program Dissolved oxygen data


3.  switch back to the home directory and run the executable by typing

source/test_sed_dom

this will run the executable and produce outputs in the outputs directory


4.  specify the file used to force the Overlying Water Column DOM

	LE22_DOM.dat ---> Ragged Point (Potomac River)
	CB52_DOM.dat ---> Point No Point (Main Stem CBay)
	CB43_DOM.dat ---> R-64 (Main Stem CBay)


5.  Run plot_seddomSFM_compare in matlab to plot the results vs observations 

make sure the matlab script knows where all the appropriate directories are

Additional information:

- All the DOM parameters are read from the input file seddom_control.in
- All other parameters are specified in the main program source code file test_sed_withDOM.F
